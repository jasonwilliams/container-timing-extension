Chrome extension that sets the attribute `containertiming` to the HTML node of
the loaded documents, and registers an observer that dumps the `container` entries
to `console.log`.

## Install

An easy way to try is:
1. Run in this folder `npm run watch`.
2. Run Chromium with `--enable-blink-features=ContainerTiming --load-extension=PATH_TO_EXTENSION/build/
